# ML_Flask
Machine Learning Flask Deployment

This data science project is building a ML spam detector with the naive bais algorithm. Additionally it was deployed through the Flask framework.
Everything was done in Python. The data set is from Kaggle and this project is inspired by a post from "towards data science".

The css framework is the very light skelaton-framework.
